# CBC-SkyNet
In three observation runs, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC) has estimated source parameters of 90 gravitational wave (GW) events from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) using optimally accurate, but slow Bayesian techniques. Approximately Bayesian, localization-only codes produce sky direction predictions in a few seconds, but their uncertainties are generally 100-200 deg2 larger than full Bayesian inference. This impedes observation of short gamma-ray bursts, which typically occur 1-2 secs after binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Parameter estimation (PE) of binary black hole (BBH) signals using deep learning has recently shown unprecedented accuracy and speed, but no work on BNS or NSBH has been published yet. We introduce CBC-SkyNet - the first neural network-based tool for sky localization of all CBC sources - BBH, BNS and NSBH. CBC-SkyNet uses a Normalizing Flow model, trained on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time series data to predict sky direction posteriors in a few milli-seconds with comparable accuracy to Bayesian inference. Using SNR time series instead of the actual GW strains, we reduce hundreds of seconds long BNS and NSBH waveforms to millisecond long SNR peaks around the merger, greatly reducing network complexity and computational overheads, and providing a viable tool for electromagnetic follow-up observations.
